# Docker based Joomla System Tests

Running automated [Joomla system tests](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/tree/4.4-dev/tests/System) with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) in a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container environment.

The idea is to have all four branches running parallel in four containers, available in host directory and mounted in Cypress container. To simplify the live Joomla standard containers are used and overwritten with the branch versions. Joomla installation itself is executed by Cypress spec.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/muhme/joomla-system-test
cd joomla-system-test
scripts/create.sh
```
