# Docker based Joomla System Tests

Running automated [Joomla system tests](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/tree/4.4-dev/tests/System) with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) in a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container environment.

The idea is to have the current four Joomla branches available in parallel for Joomla system tests.
The installation takes place in Docker containers and is automated with scripts.

To simplify life, Joomla standard containers are used as a starting point and overwritten with the Joomla
source code from the various software branches. The Joomla installation itself is executed by Cypress spec.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/muhme/joomla-system-test
cd joomla-system-test
scripts/create.sh
```

:point_right: The scripts use [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors)
to color their own log and error messages.
This can be disabled by setting environment variable [NOCOLOR=1](https://no-color.org/).

## Containers

The abbreviation `jst` stands for joomla system test:

|Name|Port|Directory :eight_spoked_asterisk: |Comment|
|----|----|-------|--------------------------|-------|
|jst_mysql| | | |
|jst_cypress| host.docker.internal:7025 | | SMTP server is only running during test execution |
|jst_mysqladmin|[7001](http://localhost:7001)| | |
|jst_44|[7044](http://localhost:7044)| /branch_44 | Joomla branch 4.4-dev |
|jst_51|[7044](http://localhost:7044)| /branch_50 | Joomla branch 5.1-dev |
|jst_52|[7044](http://localhost:7044)| /branch_51 | Joomla branch 5.2-dev |
|jst_60|[7044](http://localhost:7044)| /branch_52 | Joomla branch 6.0-dev |

:eight_spoked_asterisk: The directories are available on Docker host e.g. to inspect and change the configuration
files (`configuration.php` or `cypress.config.js`) or the test specifications below `tests/System`.
And also one available in Joomla container and all together in `jst_cypress` container.

# Usage

Test one spec with all four branches:
```
scripts/test.sh tests/System/integration/administrator/components/com_privacy/Consent.cy.js
```

Test all site specs with branch 4.4-dev:
```
scripts/test.sh 44 'tests/System/integration/site/**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'
```

# Dependencies

You need only Docker installed. Developed with macOS 14 Sonoma.
Should basically run under Linux and Windows WSL2, please let me know if you have checked this.
