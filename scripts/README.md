# JBT Scripts

The `scripts` directory serves as the source of [Joomla Branches Tester](../README.md) (JBT) functionality.
All scripts can be run multiple times, with the order of arguments being flexible, similar to a shuffled playlist.
For a quick overview of all mandatory and optional arguments, run each script with the `help` argument. For example:

```
LANG=ja scripts/database help
```
```
*** 241109 16:00:10 >>> 'scripts/database.sh help' started.

    database – Changes the database and driver for all, one or multiple Joomla web server containers.
               The mandatory database variant must be one of: mysqli mysql mariadbi mariadb pgsql.
               The optional 'socket' argument configures database access via Unix socket (default is TCP host).
               Optional Joomla instances can include one or more of the following installed: 39 44 52 53 (default is all).
               The optional argument 'help' displays this page. For full details see https://bit.ly/JBT-README.

:fairy: The random quote supports five languages, just like the
        [zitat-service.de](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/news-display/quotes/zitat-service-de/)
        Joomla module. Set `LANG` to `de` for Deutsch, `en` for English, `es` for Español, `ja` for 日本語,
        or `uk` for Українська. The gnome can't resist playing with it!
        However, you can disable the random quote by setting the environment variable `JBT_SHOW_QUOTE=false`.

The wrapper scripts (without the `.sh` extension) are used to duplicate log messages and
are not separately named in the list.

:point_right: The scripts use [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors)
to color their own log and error messages.
All messages start with three asterisks, the date and the time.
Starting a script is marked with `>>>` and ending a script with `<<<`.
Error messages are marked with " ERR ", displayed in red and directed to the standard error output (stderr) stream:

Log messages are highlighted in green and directed to the standard output (stdout) stream.
See the following example:

![scripts/test sample screenshot](../images/screen-shot.png)

JBT warnings are marked with " WRN " and colored orange.
Coloring can be avoided by setting the environment variable [NO_COLOR=1](https://no-color.org/).
